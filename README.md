# Union Styled Components Library w/Typescript [WIP]

## Getting Started

Simply run the commands below and you _should_ have a working storybook displaying all of our components.

- `git clone repo`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

## Adding Components

Each component follows the folder structure below:

- ComponentName
    - index.tsx
    - index.stories.tsx
    - styles.ts

### Index.tsx
Exports react component to be consumed

### Stories.tsx
Showcase of component for storybook

### Styles.ts
Exports a styled component consumed by the react component
